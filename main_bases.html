        <h2>> Klein-Hönningstal - "Small Valley of Hönningen" by AlbertAllrad.</h2>
        <p>
            Being one of the more recent additions to the Kaida-area, Klein-Hönningstal rose from one small house in the forest covering the gate to the 1-Year-Area.<br> Back then there were no plans to ever grow to the scale it has reached today.<br><br>
            Being inspired of IRL German castle towns like Meissen and Eisenach, the town still is growing to this day.<br> It consists of multiple levels:<br><br>
            The first area is made up of the town's top carpenters, blacksmiths, brewers and more.<br> Built around the original home of today's Castle Lord, it is the first stop for visitors and messengers from the other areas.<br> It also contains the townhall.<br><br>
            The Second area Wraps around the inner Walls and is purely residential buildings (or so the castle's army would have you believe).<br> It is secured by a high wall to the outside and has a secret emergency passage to the primary castle area, giving it's residents the best possible chances of survival during a siege.<br><br>
            At the peaks of the mountains overlooking the 1-Year-Area you can find the main Castle Buildings: To the North the Burgfried (The Donjon) with the Lord's residence and stables.<br> South of it is the secondary keep, acting as a central storage hub, also featuring most of the town's trade commerce.<br> It is directly connected to Klein-Hönningtal's numerous farms, providing an immediate supply of goods to the town and it's people.<br><br>
            Klein-Hönningstal is ever-expanding and invites Visitors and Travellers alike to stay a few nights, trade with the locals, and enjoy the rustic German way of life which the town is famous for.<br><br>
